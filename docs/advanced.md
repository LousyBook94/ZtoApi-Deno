## 🧠 Thinking Content Processing

When thinking mode is enabled (`X-Feature-Thinking: true`), the server processes the model's reasoning content according to the specified mode. You have **two ways** to control this!

### 🎯 Method 1: Per-Request Control (Recommended!)

Use the `X-Think-Tags-Mode` header to customize thinking content processing **per request**:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Think-Tags-Mode: separate" \
  # ... other headers and request body
```

### ⚙️ Method 2: Server Default Configuration

Set the default mode by modifying the `THINK_TAGS_MODE` constant in `main.ts`:

```typescript
const THINK_TAGS_MODE = "separate"; // options: "strip", "thinking", "think", "raw", "separate"
```

**Note**: The `X-Think-Tags-Mode` header always overrides the server default!

### Available Modes

1. **`"strip"`** - Removes all thinking tags and shows only the clean final answer
2. **`"thinking"`** - Converts `<details>` tags to `<thinking>` tags
3. **`"think"`** - Converts `<details>` tags to `<think>` tags
4. **`"raw"`** - Preserves original `<details>` tags as-is
5. **`"separate"`** - Extracts reasoning into a separate `reasoning_content` field

### Use Case Recommendations

- **🧹 Production Apps**: Use `"strip"` for clean, user-friendly responses
- **🐛 Debugging**: Use `"thinking"` or `"raw"` to see the model's reasoning process
- **📚 Educational Tools**: Use `"separate"` to display reasoning and answers separately
- **🔍 Advanced Processing**: Use `"raw"` for custom parsing and analysis
